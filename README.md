UCF AR Experiences - Mobile Application

Hello

Hiiiiiiii


Setting up Unity for UCF Polaris Development

Unity Account
Create a Unity account at unity.com or sign in if you have already created an account.

Unlock Unity Pro using the Unity Student Plan at unity.com/products/unity-student.

You will be added to the Unity Organization by the organization owner using your email.
(I donâ€™t think this is necessary to be honest lol)
Installing Unity
Follow the steps listed at unity.com/download to install Unity Hub.

From there, install the latest LTS version of Unity (2022.3.7f1).
It is also recommended to install Visual Studio (with Unity support).

Clone the project from GitHub.
Then, open the project from Unity Hub. 

The required packages should be automatically installed (this may take a little while).
Developing
Install Rider IDE from Jetbrains (free with student thing)

Use the Git command line (or Desktop I suppose), no Unity integration required.
Keep files small if possible! 
Also remember to pull and merge before new development!
It is also a good idea also to work on one feature at a time.

Openning Script files from Unity after connecting Rider: right click on file, open C# project

Review the [C# coding conventions
](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
Keep in mind the SOLID principles (mainly that classes should be open for extension/closed for modification and each class/function has only one purpose)
Side Notes
Load up the MainScene located in Assets -> Polaris to see the map

The geospatial sample is installed and works (mostly)
